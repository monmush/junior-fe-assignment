# Part 2: React Component Implementation

**Estimated Time**: 1.5-2 hours

## Overview

Implement a component based on a provided Figma design. Focus on clean code, responsive design, and attention to detail.

## What's Already Set Up

This project comes pre-configured with:

- ✅ **Vite** + **React** (JavaScript)
- ✅ **Tailwind CSS** (v4 with Vite plugin)
- ✅ **ESLint** configuration

## Your Task

Implement the component shown in the Figma design link provided here.

**Figma Design**: [Pricing Section Design](https://www.figma.com/design/4MMdqTilovwz3uiqMOL5NR/Pricing-Section?node-id=0-1&m=dev&t=3dRKum5YCKAmL1Rh-1)

## Requirements

### 1. Component Implementation

- Match the Figma design as closely as possible
- Implement responsive design (mobile & desktop)
- Use clean, reusable component structure
- Follow React best practices

### 2. Styling Options

**Option 1: Tailwind CSS (Recommended)**

- Tailwind is already set up and ready to use
- See examples in `src/App.jsx`

**Option 2: Regular CSS**

- Use `src/App.css` or create component-specific CSS files
- Feel free to remove Tailwind if you prefer

### 3. Code Quality

Your code should demonstrate:

- ✅ **Clean Code**: Readable, well-structured
- ✅ **Component Structure**: Reusable, modular components
- ✅ **Best Practices**: Modern React patterns
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop
- ✅ **Code Organization**: Logical folder structure

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd part-2-react
npm install
```

### 2. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` to see your changes live.

### 3. Project Structure (Suggested)

```
part-2-react/
├── src/
│   ├── components/        (Your components here)
│   ├── App.jsx           (Main app - replace the placeholder)
│   ├── App.css           (Custom CSS if needed)
│   └── index.css         (Tailwind import)
├── package.json
└── vite.config.js
```

### 4. Implementation Steps

1. Review the Figma design carefully
2. Plan your component structure
3. Build components incrementally
4. Test responsiveness at different screen sizes
5. Refine styling to match the design
